utility:

config:
- [ ] Launch files to specify the pipeline config: transmitter, impairments, acq, reacq, spread, demod, decode, etc.

transmitter:
- [ ] Implement simple sine wave transmitter
- [ ] Frame struct to send the signals in a constant stream

visualization:
- [ ] Add 3D plot, x: frequency, y: time, z: amplitude, with color gradient. Goal is to visualize how the signal looks like over time
