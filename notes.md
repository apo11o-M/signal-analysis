# Some Notes and Thoughts on Signal Analysis

Signal analysis is hard bruh

In computer graphics we typically only need to work on objects in a 2D or 3D space, which is much more intuitive to visualize and understand. However in signal processing we often need to work in higher dimensional spaces such as frequency and time domains, which are not straightforward for someone without a signal background.

Some confusing parts when I just started this project and learning about signal processing:

- Phase, it was incredibly confusing on why we use "phase" instead of just frequency.
- Complex numbers, similar to phase, why complex numbers instead of say x and y components like a normal person would in say computer graphics.
